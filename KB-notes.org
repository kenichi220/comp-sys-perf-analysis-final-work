** 2025-09-02 Base configuration on TensorFlow/Pytorch
  [20:23:41; 02.09.2025] I use my machine, it has a Nvidia RTX pre
  configurate
  
  [21:14:08; 02.09.2025] First try to run the training, fail: "Failed
  to initialize NVML:   Driver/library version mismatch
  NVML library version: 580.76"
  
  [21:35:19; 02.09.2025] I`ll go to PCAD infrastructure
** 2025-09-03 Nvidia CUDA
  [07:14:37; 03.09.2025] Nvidia CUDA and Toolkit are incompatible
  version, Tensor requires 12.X or lower, my configuration is 13.0.
  
  [07:22:19; 03.09.2025] At the moment I`m not using PCAD.
  
  [13:06:18; 03.09.2025] Runned first training test:
       Loss in test: 1.8767
       Accuracy in test: 0.3092
       
** 2025-09-04 Pcad
 [19:04:01; 04.09.2025] Now I using PCAD structure

 [19:04:27; 04.09.2025] I found the command, what was missing,
 this command has on: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip?hl=pt-br
 and I'm using *pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]* after using
 *pip install tensorflow* in venv to
 recognition the GPU

 [20:35:30; 04.09.2025] First train with a GPU and test recognition in
 Tupi4

 [20:43:36; 04.09.2025] Use this to training in parallel:
 https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/keras?hl=pt-br
 
** 2025-09-05 .
https://www.tensorflow.org/install
