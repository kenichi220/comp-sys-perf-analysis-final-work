# ACM Small in ORG
The ACM small template in OrgMode, just type make (after installing
acmart.cls in your system). Be aware that this example is compatible
with OrgMode 9.*. Earlier or later OrgMode versions may require minor
modifications to the Makefile and/or the ORG file.  For a detailed
explanation on why and how to write reproducible articles using
OrgMode, please visit the following [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/1_replicable_article_laboratory_notebook/index.org][page]].
